This project provides React components that use [Zendesk Garden](http://zendeskgarden.github.io/css-components/) for styling.

[Garden Design Documentation](http://goto.zendesk.com/garden) documents the design decisions for these components as well as overall design philosophy.

## Garden (@next)

We are currently working on a new version of Garden with a focus on flexibility, accessibility, and standardization!
